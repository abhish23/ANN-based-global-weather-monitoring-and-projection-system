Weather forecasting has been an important field of research in the last few decades. Weather forecast are made by collecting quantitative data about the present state of the atmosphere and using scientific understanding of atmospheric process to project how the atmosphere will evolve in the near future. Weather prediction is basically based upon the historical time series data. In initial days weather forecasting was done through implementation of statistical methods and physical simulations but now a days prediction are made by other predictive analytical processes which are more evolved in accuracy. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been applied extensively to both regress and classify weather phenomena. As the data of forecast is nonlinear and follows some irregular trends and patterns. ANN has evolved out to be a better way to improve the accuracy and reliability. This project will depict the extent by which global parameter affects the havoc caused in local regions. It will also show that, how Global warming and climate change creates turmoil economically, socially as well as destruction to global flora and fauna. The weather forecast system needs to be intelligent so that one can easily read the statistical data and generate patterns and further trends to study and based on past data one can able to predict the future.
